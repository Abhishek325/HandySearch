HandySearch
------------------------------
A search program that remembers your search query to get you the same search results for a particular search engine. For e.g. You search for "MVC DB connection in ASP.NET" and you select search engine as Google/Yahoo.
You get specfic lists of page in search results of search engine. These pages might be required again. So HandySearch saves you search term "MVC DB connection in ASP.NET" to avoid looking back in browser history or searching again and again with other terms for same results.

To make it run for you:
1. Execute the database file (userdb.sql) in your server.
2. Change connection string in the program.
3. Run the proggram in your IDE and publish it as per you requirements.
